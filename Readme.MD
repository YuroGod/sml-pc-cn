<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Clone The Repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lukas0x1/sml-pc.git
```

### Unzipping lib/release/libmem.7z


### Compiling

```cmd
mkdir build
cd build

## VS has issue with libmem when linking so use CLI (x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022)
